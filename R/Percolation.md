# Percolation


## Statistics

### Number of Channels / Clusters
- percolating clusters;
- non-percolating, but connected to the boundary;
- non-connected to the boundary;

### Area
- percolating clusters;
- non-percolating, but connected to the boundary;
- non-connected to the boundary (i.e. fully bounded);

### Dead-End Components
- area of dead-end sub-channels inside a percolating cluster;
- dead-end area with specified maximum inflow (e.g. inflow of 1 unit);


### Linear Channels with Blocks & Pores
> rgrid.channel()
- density of percolating channels;
- minimal & maximal length of percolating channels;
- minimal & maximal height of percolating channels;
